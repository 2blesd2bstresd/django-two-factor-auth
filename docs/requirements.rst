Requirements
============

Django
------
All Django versions listed by the Django Project under `Supported versions`_
are supported. Currently this list includes Django 1.4, 1.7 and 1.8. The
minimal version of the Django 1.4 series is 1.4.2 as it includes the ``six``
compatibility layer used for transitioning to Python 3.

Python
------
The following Python versions are supported: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. As support
for older Django versions is dropped, the minimum version might be raised. See
also `What Python version can I use with Django?`_.

django-otp
----------
This project is used for generating one-time passwords. Version 0.2 is
supported.
